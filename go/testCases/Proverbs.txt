The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
To give subtlety to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:
For they shall be an ornament of grace unto your head, and chains about your neck.
My son, if sinners entice you, consent you not.
If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privately for the innocent without cause:
Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
Cast in your lot among us; let us all have one purse:
My son, walk not you in the way with them; refrain your foot from their path:
For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privately for their own lives.
So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which takes away the life of the owners thereof.
Wisdom cries without; she utters her voice in the streets:
She cries in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she utters her words, saying,
How long, all of you simple ones, will all of you love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
Because I have called, and all of you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
But all of you have set at nothing all my counsel, and refused my reproof:
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes;
When your fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish comes upon you.
Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
They refused my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
But whoso hearkens unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
My son, if you will receive my words, and hide my commandments with you;
So that you incline yours ear unto wisdom, and apply yours heart to understanding;
Yea, if you cry after knowledge, and lift up your voice for understanding;
If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;
Then shall you understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
For the LORD gives wisdom: out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
He keeps the paths of judgment, and perserves the way of his saints.
Then shall you understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
When wisdom enters into yours heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto your soul;
Discretion shall preserve you, understanding shall keep you:
To deliver you from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaks perverse things;
Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of the wicked;
Whose ways are crooked, and they perverse in their paths:
To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flatters with her words;
Which forsakes the guide of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God.
For her house inclines unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
That you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
My son, forget not my law; but let yours heart keep my commandments:
For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to you.
Let not mercy and truth forsake you: bind them about your neck; write them upon the table of yours heart:
So shall you find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
Trust in the LORD with all yours heart; and lean not unto yours own understanding.
In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.
Be not wise in yours own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
It shall be health to your navel, and marrow to your bones.
Honour the LORD with your substance, and with the first-fruits of all yours increase:
So shall your barns be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst out with new wine.
My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
For whom the LORD loves he corrects; even as a father the son in whom he delights.
Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.
For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
She is more precious than rubies: and all the things you can desire are not to be compared unto her.
Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retains her.
The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.
By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
My son, let not them depart from yours eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
So shall they be life unto your soul, and grace to your neck.
Then shall you walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.
When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yea, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.
Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.
For the LORD shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being taken.
Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of yours hand to do it.
Say not unto your neighbour, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it by you.
Devise not evil against your neighbour, seeing he dwells securely by you.
Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done you no harm.
Envy you not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
For the perverse is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.
The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the habitation of the just.
Surely he scorns the scorners: but he gives grace unto the lowly.
The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
Hear, all of you children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
For I give you good doctrine, forsake all of you not my law.
For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
He taught me also, and said unto me, Let yours heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve you: love her, and she shall keep you.
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all your getting get understanding.
Exalt her, and she shall promote you: she shall bring you to honour, when you do embrace her.
She shall give to yours head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to you.
Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of your life shall be many.
I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths.
When you go, your steps shall not be straitened; and when you run, you shall not stumble.
Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is your life.
Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day.
The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
My son, attend to my words; incline yours ear unto my sayings.
Let them not depart from yours eyes; keep them in the midst of yours heart.
For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
Keep your heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
Put away from you a perverse mouth, and perverse lips put far from you.
Let yours eyes look right on, and let yours eyelids look straight before you.
Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove your foot from evil.
My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow yours ear to my understanding:
That you may regard discretion, and that your lips may keep knowledge.
For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
Lest you should ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that you can not know them.
Hear me now therefore, O all of you children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
Remove your way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
Lest you give yours honour unto others, and your years unto the cruel:
Lest strangers be filled with your wealth; and your labours be in the house of a stranger;
And you mourn at the last, when your flesh and your body are consumed,
And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
Drink waters out of yours own cistern, and running waters out of yours own well.
Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
Let them be only yours own, and not strangers' with you.
Let your fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of your youth.
Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and be you ravished always with her love.
And why will you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his activities.
His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.
He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
My son, if you be guarantor for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,
You are snared with the words of your mouth, you are taken with the words of your mouth.
Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.
Give not sleep to yours eyes, nor slumber to yours eyelids.
Deliver yourself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
Provides her food in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.
How long will you sleep, O sluggard? when will you arise out of your sleep?
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
So shall your poverty come as one that travels, and your lack as an armed man.
A naughty person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth.
He winks with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers;
Perverseness is in his heart, he devises mischief continually; he sows discord.
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
These six things does the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
An heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
A false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brethren.
My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:
Bind them continually upon yours heart, and tie them about your neck.
When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you; and when you awake, it shall talk with you.
For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
Lust not after her beauty in yours heart; neither let her take you with her eyelids.
For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
So he that goes in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever touches her shall not be innocent.
Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
But whoso commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding: he that does it destroys his own soul.
A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.
My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with you.
Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of yours eye.
Bind them upon your fingers, write them upon the table of yours heart.
Say unto wisdom, You are my sister; and call understanding your kinswoman:
That they may keep you from the strange woman, from the stranger which flatters with her words.
For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtle of heart.
(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
Now is she without, now in the streets, and lies in wait at every corner.)
So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an shameless face said unto him,
I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.
Therefore came I forth to meet you, diligently to seek your face, and I have found you.
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:
He has taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.
With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
He goes after her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hastes to the snare, and knows not that it is for his life.
Hearken unto me now therefore, O all of you children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
Let not yours heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
For she has cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
Does not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
She stands in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.
O all of you simple, understand wisdom: and, all of you fools, be all of you of an understanding heart.
Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing perverse or perverse in them.
They are all plain to him that understands, and right to them that find knowledge.
Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth, do I hate.
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before even the earth was.
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
While yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
Now therefore hearken unto me, O all of you children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.
Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
Blessed is the man that hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
For whoso finds me finds life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
But he that sins against me wrongs his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn out her seven pillars:
She has killed her beasts; she has mingled her wine; she has also furnished her table.
She has sent forth her maidens: she cries upon the highest places of the city,
Whoso is simple, let him turn in here: as for him that wants understanding, she says to him,
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
He that reproves a scorner gets to himself shame: and he that rebukes a wicked man gets himself a blot.
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate you: rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
For by me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased.
If you be wise, you shall be wise for yourself: but if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.
A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knows nothing.
For she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
To call passengers who go right on their ways:
Whoso is simple, let him turn in here: and as for him that wants understanding, she says to him,
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
But he knows not that the dead are there; and that her guest are in the depths of hell.
The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivers from death.
The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casts away the substance of the wicked.
He becomes poor that deals with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent makes rich.

Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.
The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.
The labour of the righteous tends to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.
He is in the way of life that keeps instruction: but he that refuses reproof errs.
He that hides hatred with lying lips, and he that utters a slander, is a fool.
In the multitude of words there wants not sin: but he that refrains his lips is wise.
The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.
The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for lack of wisdom.
The blessing of the LORD, it makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.
It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding has wisdom.
The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
As the whirlwind passes, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.

I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
Who has ascended up into heaven, or descended? who has gathered the wind in his fists? who has bound the waters in a garment? who has established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if you can tell?

Add you not unto his words, lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.
Two things have I required of you; deny me them not before I die:
Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
Lest I be full, and deny you, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty.
There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother.
There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.
There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
The horseleach has two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:

There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer;
The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
The spider takes hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.
There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turns not away for any;
A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.

The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
Give not your strength unto women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:

Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
Open your mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.

She considers a field, and buys it: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
She girds her loins with strength, and strengthens her arms.
